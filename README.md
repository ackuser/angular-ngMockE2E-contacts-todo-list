## Avocet JavaScript Code Test, the challenge



#### Create a small, simple web app for managing contacts.



##### Key requirements:

* A contact should have a name and email
* Ability to add a new contact
* An overview of existing contacts
* Ability to remove an existing contact
* Some way to locate/find an existing contact in the list

##### Explanation


I have done it with a fake back-end just to show you more functionalities
rather than having a simple controller with all the variables.

I could do that with a real back-end in nodejs and mongodb, but I guessed, it was a good opportunity
to make you have an idea about my capacities in terms of testing simulating a REST api.

I decided to do it with $http although you can do with $resource as well

Why javascript & angularjs & mean stack? Better, faster, easier, testable, maintainable...
